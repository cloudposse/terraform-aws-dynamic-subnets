  Terraform module to provision public and private [`subnets`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html) in an existing [`VPC`](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc)


  __Note:__ This module is intended for use with an existing VPC and existing Internet Gateway.
  To create a new VPC, use [terraform-aws-vpc](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc) module.

  __Note:__ Due to Terraform [limitations](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26755#issuecomment-719103775),
  many optional inputs to this module are specified as a `list(string)` that can have zero or one element, rather than
  as a `string` that could be empty or `null`. The designation of an input as a `list` type does not necessarily
  mean that you can supply more than one value in the list, so check the input's description before supplying more than one value.

  The core function of this module is to create 2 sets of subnets, a "public" set with bidirectional access to the
  public internet, and a "private" set behind a firewall with egress-only access to the public internet. This 
  includes dividing up a given CIDR range so that a each subnet gets its own 
  distinct CIDR range within that range, and then creating those subnets in the appropriate availability zones.
  The intention is to keep this module relatively simple and easy to use for the most popular use cases. 
  In its default configuration, this module creates 1 public subnet and 1 private subnet in each
  of the specified availability zones. The public subnets are configured for bi-directional traffic to the
  public internet, while the private subnets are configured for egress-only traffic to the public internet.
  Rather than provide a wealth of configuration options allowing for numerous special cases, this module 
  provides some common options and further provides the ability to suppress the creation of resources, allowing 
  you to create and configure them as you like from outside this module. For example, rather than give you the
  option to customize the Network ACL, the module gives you the option to create a completely open one (and control
  access via Security Groups and other means) or not create one at all, allowing you to create and configure one yourself.

  ### Public subnets

  This module defines a public subnet as one that has direct access to an internet gateway and can accept incoming connection requests. 
  In the simplest configuration, the module creates a single route table with a default route targeted to the
  VPC's internet gateway, and associates all the public subnets with that single route table. 

  Likewise it creates a single Network ACL with associated rules allowing all ingress and all egress, 
  and associates that ACL with all the public subnets. 

  ### Private subnets

  A private subnet may be able to initiate traffic to the public internet through a NAT gateway,
  a NAT instance, or an egress-only internet gateway, or it might only have direct access to other
  private subnets. In the simple configuration, for IPv4 and/or IPv6 with NAT64 enabled via `public_dns64_enabled`
  or `private_dns64_enabled`, the module creates 1 NAT Gateway or NAT Instance for each
  private subnet (in the public subnet in the same availability zone), creates 1 route table for each private subnet, 
  and adds to that route table a default route from the subnet to its NAT Gateway or Instance. For IPv6,
  the module adds a route to the Egress-Only Internet Gateway configured via input.

  As with the Public subnets, the module creates a single Network ACL with associated rules allowing all ingress and 
  all egress, and associates that ACL with all the private subnets. 

  ### Customization for special use cases

  Various features are controlled by `bool` inputs with names ending in `_enabled`. By changing the default
  values, you can enable or disable creation of public subnets, private subnets, route tables, 
  NAT gateways, NAT instances, or Network ACLs. So for example, you could use this module to create only
  private subnets and the open Network ACL, and then add your own route table associations to the subnets
  and route all non-local traffic to a Transit Gateway or VPN.

  ### CIDR allocation

  For IPv4, you provide a CIDR and the module divides the address space into the largest CIDRs possible that are still
  small enough to accommodate `max_subnet_count` subnets of each enabled type (public or private). When `max_subnet_count`
  is left at the default `0`, it is set to the total number of availability zones in the region. Private subnets
  are allocated out of the first half of the reserved range, and public subnets are allocated out of the second half.

  For IPv6, you provide a `/56` CIDR and the module assigns `/64` subnets of that CIDR in consecutive order starting
  at zero. (You have the option of specifying a list of CIDRs instead.) As with IPv4, enough CIDRs are allocated to
  cover `max_subnet_count` private and public subnets (when both are enabled, which is the default), with the private
  subnets being allocated out of the lower half of the reservation and the public subnets allocated out of the upper half.

  ## Deployment Modes and Configuration

  This module supports various deployment modes through flexible configuration variables. Understanding these options
  allows you to tailor the subnet architecture to your specific use case.

  ### Availability Zone Selection

  **`availability_zones`** - Explicitly specify which AZs to use:
  - Provide a list of AZ names (e.g., `["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]`)
  - The list order **must be stable** - do not reorder or Terraform will recreate subnets
  - If empty, the module uses all available AZs in the region (sorted alphabetically)
  - Can be truncated by `max_subnet_count` if you specify more AZs than the limit

  **`availability_zone_ids`** - Use AZ IDs instead of names:
  - Provide a list of AZ IDs (e.g., `["use1-az1", "use1-az2"]`)
  - Overrides `availability_zones` when set
  - Useful for multi-account consistency (AZ names like "us-east-1a" map to different physical locations across accounts, but AZ IDs are consistent)
  - The module automatically translates IDs to names for resource creation

  ### Subnet Count and CIDR Reservation

  **`max_subnet_count`** - Controls CIDR reservation for future growth:
  - Default: `0` (reserves CIDRs for all AZs in the region)
  - Recommended: Set to `3` or the maximum number of AZs you anticipate using
  - The module reserves CIDR space for this many subnets of **each type** (public and private)
  - Example: If a region has 4 AZs but you set `max_subnet_count = 3`, only 3 subnets will be created, but you can later expand to the 4th without changing existing subnet CIDRs
  - **Important**: This must be a constant value, not computed, due to Terraform limitations

  **`subnets_per_az_count`** - Create multiple subnets of each type per AZ:
  - Default: `1` (one public and one private subnet per AZ)
  - Set to `2` or higher to create multiple subnets per AZ
  - Useful for segmenting workloads within the same AZ (e.g., separate subnets for web tier, app tier, data tier)
  - Each subnet gets its own CIDR from the allocated range
  - Works with `subnets_per_az_names` for organized outputs

  **`subnets_per_az_names`** - Assign names to subnets for better organization:
  - Default: `["common"]`
  - Provide a list of names matching `subnets_per_az_count` (e.g., `["web", "app", "data"]`)
  - Names are used as keys in the `named_private_subnets_map` and `named_public_subnets_map` outputs
  - Makes it easy to reference specific subnet groups in other modules
  - Example: `module.subnets.named_private_subnets_map["web"]` returns all web-tier private subnet IDs

  ### Subnet Type Selection

  **`public_subnets_enabled`** - Enable/disable public subnet creation:
  - Default: `true`
  - Set to `false` to create only private subnets
  - When disabled, NAT Gateways/Instances are also disabled (since they require public subnets)
  - Use case: Internal-only VPCs that route through Transit Gateway or VPN

  **`private_subnets_enabled`** - Enable/disable private subnet creation:
  - Default: `true`
  - Set to `false` to create only public subnets
  - When disabled, NAT Gateways/Instances are also disabled (since private subnets don't need them)
  - Use case: DMZ or edge VPCs with only internet-facing resources

  ### NAT Configuration and Cost Optimization

  **`max_nats`** - Limit the number of NAT devices for cost savings:
  - Default: `999` (creates one NAT per AZ for high availability)
  - Set to `1` for cost savings (single NAT, reduced availability)
  - Set to `2` for balance between cost and availability (two NATs across AZs)
  - **Cost impact**: Each NAT Gateway costs ~$32/month plus data transfer fees
  - **Availability impact**: If the NAT fails (or its AZ fails), private subnets lose internet access
  - The module distributes NAT devices across the first N availability zones
  - Example: With 3 AZs and `max_nats = 1`, only the first AZ gets a NAT Gateway

  ### Common Deployment Patterns

  **Standard HA deployment** (default):
  ```hcl
  # 1 public + 1 private subnet per AZ, with NAT Gateway per AZ
  public_subnets_enabled  = true
  private_subnets_enabled = true
  max_subnet_count        = 3  # Reserve space for 3 AZs
  max_nats                = 999 # One NAT per AZ
  ```

  **Cost-optimized deployment**:
  ```hcl
  # Single NAT Gateway shared across all private subnets
  max_nats = 1
  # Everything else default
  ```

  **Private-only with Transit Gateway**:
  ```hcl
  # Private subnets only, routing through TGW
  public_subnets_enabled  = false
  private_subnets_enabled = true
  nat_gateway_enabled     = false
  # Add custom routes to TGW externally
  ```

  **Public-only (DMZ) deployment**:
  ```hcl
  # Public subnets only for internet-facing resources
  public_subnets_enabled  = true
  private_subnets_enabled = false
  ```

  **Multi-tier architecture per AZ**:
  ```hcl
  # 3 private subnets per AZ (web, app, data)
  subnets_per_az_count = 3
  subnets_per_az_names = ["web", "app", "data"]
  # Access subnets via: named_private_subnets_map["web"]
  ```

  **Multi-account with consistent AZs**:
  ```hcl
  # Use AZ IDs for consistency across accounts
  availability_zone_ids = ["use1-az1", "use1-az2", "use1-az4"]
  # These map to the same physical locations across all accounts
  ```

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  ```hcl
  module "subnets" {
    source = "cloudposse/dynamic-subnets/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"
    namespace           = "eg"
    stage               = "prod"
    name                = "app"
    vpc_id              = "vpc-XXXXXXXX"
    igw_id              = ["igw-XXXXXXXX"]
    ipv4_cidr_block     = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
    availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
  }
  ```

  Create only private subnets, route to transit gateway:

  ```hcl
  module "private_tgw_subnets" {
    source = "cloudposse/dynamic-subnets/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"
    namespace           = "eg"
    stage               = "prod"
    name                = "app"
    vpc_id              = "vpc-XXXXXXXX"
    igw_id              = ["igw-XXXXXXXX"]
    ipv4_cidr_block     = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
    availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]

    nat_gateway_enabled    = false
    public_subnets_enabled = false
  }

  resource "aws_route" "private" {
    count = length(module.private_tgw_subnets.private_route_table_ids)

    route_table_id         = module.private_tgw_subnets.private_route_table_ids[count.index]
    destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    transit_gateway_id     = "tgw-XXXXXXXXX"
  }
  ```

  See [examples](examples) for working examples. In particular, see [examples/nacls](examples/nacls) 
  for an example of how to create custom Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) outside of
  but in conjunction with this module.
