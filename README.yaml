  Terraform module to provision public and private [`subnets`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html) in an existing [`VPC`](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc)

  
  __Note:__ This module is intended for use with an existing VPC and existing Internet Gateway.
  To create a new VPC, use [terraform-aws-vpc](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc) module.
  
  __Note:__ Due to Terraform [limitations](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26755#issuecomment-719103775),
  many optional inputs to this module are specified as a `list(string)` that can have zero or one element, rather than
  as a `string` that could be empty or `null`. The designation of an input as a `list` type does not necessarily
  mean that you can supply more than one value in the list, so check the input's description before supplying more than one value.
  
  The core feature of this module is dividing up a given CIDR range so that a set of subnets each gets its own 
  distinct CIDR range within that range, and then creating those subnets in the appropriate availability zones.
  The intention is to keep this module relatively simple and easy to use for the most popular use cases. 
  In its default configuration, this module creates 1 public subnet and 1 private subnet in each
  of the specified availability zones. The public subnets are configured for bi-directional traffic to the
  public internet, while the private subnets are configured for egress-only traffic to the public internet.
  Rather than provide a wealth of configuration options allowing for numerous special cases, this module 
  provides some common options and further provides the ability to suppress the creation of resources, allowing 
  you to create and configure them as you like from outside this module. For example, rather than give you the
  option to customize the Network ACL, the module gives you the option to create a completely open one (and control
  access via Security Groups and other means) or not create one at all, allowing you to create and configure one yourself.
  
  ### Public subnets
  
  This module defines a public subnet as one that has direct access to an internet gateway and can accept incoming connection requests. 
  In the simplest configuration, the module creates a single route table with a default route targeted to the
  VPC's internet gateway, and associates all the public subnets with that single route table. 
  
  Likewise it creates a single Network ACL with associated rules allowing all ingress and all egress, 
  and associates that ACL with all the public subnets. 

  ### Private subnets
  
  A private subnet may be able to initiate traffic to the public internet through a NAT gateway,
  a NAT instance, or an egress-only internet gateway, or it might only have direct access to other
  private subnets. In the simple configuration, for IPv4 and/or IPv6 with NAT64 enabled via `public_dns64_enabled`
  or `private_dns64_enabled`, the module creates 1 NAT Gateway or NAT Instance for each
  private subnet (in the public subnet in the same availability zone), creates 1 route table for each private subnet, 
  and adds to that route table a default route from the subnet to its NAT Gateway or Instance. For IPv6,
  the module adds a route to the Egress-Only Internet Gateway configured via input.

  As with the Public subnets, the module creates a single Network ACL with associated rules allowing all ingress and 
  all egress, and associates that ACL with all the private subnets. 
  
  ### Customization for special use cases
  
  Various features are controlled by `bool` inputs with names ending in `_enabled`. By changing the default
  values, you can enable or disable creation of public subnets, private subnets, route tables, 
  NAT gateways, NAT instances, or Network ACLs. So for example, you could use this module to create only
  private subnets and the open Network ACL, and then add your own route table associations to the subnets
  and route all non-local traffic to a Transit Gateway or VPN.
  
  ### CIDR allocation
  
  For IPv4, you provide a CIDR and the module divides the address space into the largest CIDRs possible that are still
  small enough to accommodate `max_subnet_count` subnets of each enabled type (public or private). When `max_subnet_count`
  is left at the default `0`, it is set to the total number of availability zones in the region. Private subnets
  are allocated out of the first half of the reserved range, and public subnets are allocated out of the second half.
  
  For IPv6, you provide a `/56` CIDR and the module assigns `/64` subnets of that CIDR in consecutive order starting
  at zero. (You have the option of specifying a list of CIDRs instead.) As with IPv4, enough CIDRs are allocated to 
  cover `max_subnet_count` private and public subnets (when both are enabled, which is the default), with the private
  subnets being allocated out of the lower half of the reservation and the public subnets allocated out of the upper half.

usage: |-
  ```hcl

    source = "cloudposse/dynamic-subnets/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"
    namespace           = "eg"
    stage               = "prod"
    name                = "app"
    vpc_id              = "vpc-XXXXXXXX"
    igw_id              = ["igw-XXXXXXXX"]
    ipv4_cidr_block          = "10.0.0.0/16"
    availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
  }
  ```

  ```hcl
  module "subnets_with_existing_ips" {
    source = "cloudposse/dynamic-subnets/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"
    namespace           = "eg"

    vpc_id              = "vpc-XXXXXXXX"
    igw_id              = ["igw-XXXXXXXX"]
    cidr_block          = "10.0.0.0/16"
    availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
    nat_gateway_enabled = true
    nat_elastic_ips     = ["1.2.3.4", "1.2.3.5"]
