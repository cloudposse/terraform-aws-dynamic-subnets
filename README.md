Terraform module to provision public and private [`subnets`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html) in an existing [`VPC`](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc)


__Note:__ This module is intended for use with an existing VPC and existing Internet Gateway.
To create a new VPC, use [terraform-aws-vpc](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc) module.

__Note:__ Due to Terraform [limitations](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26755#issuecomment-719103775),
many optional inputs to this module are specified as a `list(string)` that can have zero or one element, rather than
as a `string` that could be empty or `null`. The designation of an input as a `list` type does not necessarily
mean that you can supply more than one value in the list, so check the input's description before supplying more than one value.

The core function of this module is to create 2 sets of subnets, a "public" set with bidirectional access to the
public internet, and a "private" set behind a firewall with egress-only access to the public internet. This 
includes dividing up a given CIDR range so that a each subnet gets its own 
distinct CIDR range within that range, and then creating those subnets in the appropriate availability zones.
The intention is to keep this module relatively simple and easy to use for the most popular use cases. 
In its default configuration, this module creates 1 public subnet and 1 private subnet in each
of the specified availability zones. The public subnets are configured for bi-directional traffic to the
public internet, while the private subnets are configured for egress-only traffic to the public internet.
Rather than provide a wealth of configuration options allowing for numerous special cases, this module 
provides some common options and further provides the ability to suppress the creation of resources, allowing 
you to create and configure them as you like from outside this module. For example, rather than give you the
option to customize the Network ACL, the module gives you the option to create a completely open one (and control
access via Security Groups and other means) or not create one at all, allowing you to create and configure one yourself.

### Public subnets

This module defines a public subnet as one that has direct access to an internet gateway and can accept incoming connection requests. 
In the simplest configuration, the module creates a single route table with a default route targeted to the
VPC's internet gateway, and associates all the public subnets with that single route table. 

Likewise it creates a single Network ACL with associated rules allowing all ingress and all egress, 
and associates that ACL with all the public subnets. 

### Private subnets

A private subnet may be able to initiate traffic to the public internet through a NAT gateway,
a NAT instance, or an egress-only internet gateway, or it might only have direct access to other
private subnets. In the simple configuration, for IPv4 and/or IPv6 with NAT64 enabled via `public_dns64_enabled`
or `private_dns64_enabled`, the module creates 1 NAT Gateway or NAT Instance for each
private subnet (in the public subnet in the same availability zone), creates 1 route table for each private subnet, 
and adds to that route table a default route from the subnet to its NAT Gateway or Instance. For IPv6,
the module adds a route to the Egress-Only Internet Gateway configured via input.

As with the Public subnets, the module creates a single Network ACL with associated rules allowing all ingress and 
all egress, and associates that ACL with all the private subnets. 

### Customization for special use cases

Various features are controlled by `bool` inputs with names ending in `_enabled`. By changing the default
values, you can enable or disable creation of public subnets, private subnets, route tables, 
NAT gateways, NAT instances, or Network ACLs. So for example, you could use this module to create only
private subnets and the open Network ACL, and then add your own route table associations to the subnets
and route all non-local traffic to a Transit Gateway or VPN.

### CIDR allocation

For IPv4, you provide a CIDR and the module divides the address space into the largest CIDRs possible that are still
small enough to accommodate `max_subnet_count` subnets of each enabled type (public or private). When `max_subnet_count`
is left at the default `0`, it is set to the total number of availability zones in the region. Private subnets
are allocated out of the first half of the reserved range, and public subnets are allocated out of the second half.

For IPv6, you provide a `/56` CIDR and the module assigns `/64` subnets of that CIDR in consecutive order starting
at zero. (You have the option of specifying a list of CIDRs instead.) As with IPv4, enough CIDRs are allocated to 
cover `max_subnet_count` private and public subnets (when both are enabled, which is the default), with the private
subnets being allocated out of the lower half of the reservation and the public subnets allocated out of the upper half.

## Usage

```hcl
module "subnets" {
  source = "cloudposse/dynamic-subnets/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"
  namespace           = "eg"
  stage               = "prod"
  name                = "app"
  vpc_id              = "vpc-XXXXXXXX"
  igw_id              = ["igw-XXXXXXXX"]
  ipv4_cidr_block     = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
}
```

Create only private subnets, route to transit gateway:

```hcl
module "private_tgw_subnets" {
  source = "cloudposse/dynamic-subnets/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"
  namespace           = "eg"
  stage               = "prod"
  name                = "app"
  vpc_id              = "vpc-XXXXXXXX"
  igw_id              = ["igw-XXXXXXXX"]
  ipv4_cidr_block     = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]

  nat_gateway_enabled    = false
  public_subnets_enabled = false
}

resource "aws_route" "private" {
  count = length(module.private_tgw_subnets.private_route_table_ids)

  route_table_id         = module.private_tgw_subnets.private_route_table_ids[count.index]
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  transit_gateway_id     = "tgw-XXXXXXXXX"
}
```

See [examples](examples) for working examples. In particular, see [examples/nacls](examples/nacls) 
for an example of how to create custom Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) outside of
but in conjunction with this module.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.








## Subnet calculation logic

`terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets` creates a set of subnets based on various CIDR inputs and 
the maximum possible number of subnets, which is `max_subnet_count` when specified or
the number of Availability Zones in the region when `max_subnet_count` is left at 
its default value of zero.

You can explicitly provide CIDRs for subnets via `ipv4_cidrs` and `ipv6_cidrs` inputs if you want,
but the usual use case is to provide a single CIDR which this module will subdivide into a set
of CIDRs as follows:

1. Get number of available AZ in the region:
```
existing_az_count = length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names)
```
2. Determine how many sets of subnets are being created. (Usually it is `2`: `public` and `private`): `subnet_type_count`.
3. Multiply the results of (1) and (2) to determine how many CIDRs to reserve:
```
cidr_count = existing_az_count * subnet_type_count
```

4. Calculate the number of bits needed to enumerate all the CIDRs:
```
subnet_bits = ceil(log(cidr_count, 2))
```
5. Reserve CIDRs for private subnets using [`cidrsubnet`](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/cidrsubnet): 
```
private_subnet_cidrs = [ for netnumber in range(0, existing_az_count): cidrsubnet(cidr_block, subnet_bits, netnumber) ]
```
6. Reserve CIDRs for public subnets in the second half of the CIDR block:
```
public_subnet_cidrs = [ for netnumber in range(existing_az_count, existing_az_count * 2): cidrsubnet(cidr_block, subnet_bits, netnumber) ]
```


Note that this means that, for example, in a region with 4 availability zones, if you specify only 3 availability zones 
in `var.availability_zones`, this module will still reserve CIDRs for the 4th zone. This is so that if you later
want to expand into that zone, the existing subnet CIDR assignments will not be disturbed. If you do not want
to reserve these CIDRs, set `max_subnet_count` to the number of zones you are actually using.
