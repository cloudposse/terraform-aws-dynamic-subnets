Terraform module to provision public and private [`subnets`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html) in an existing [`VPC`](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc)


__Note:__ This module is intended for use with an existing VPC and existing Internet Gateway.
To create a new VPC, use [terraform-aws-vpc](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc) module.

__Note:__ Due to Terraform [limitations](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26755#issuecomment-719103775),
many optional inputs to this module are specified as a `list(string)` that can have zero or one element, rather than
as a `string` that could be empty or `null`. The designation of an input as a `list` type does not necessarily
mean that you can supply more than one value in the list, so check the input's description before supplying more than one value.

The core function of this module is to create 2 sets of subnets, a "public" set with bidirectional access to the
public internet, and a "private" set behind a firewall with egress-only access to the public internet. This
includes dividing up a given CIDR range so that a each subnet gets its own
distinct CIDR range within that range, and then creating those subnets in the appropriate availability zones.
The intention is to keep this module relatively simple and easy to use for the most popular use cases.
In its default configuration, this module creates 1 public subnet and 1 private subnet in each
of the specified availability zones. The public subnets are configured for bi-directional traffic to the
public internet, while the private subnets are configured for egress-only traffic to the public internet.

The module supports creating different numbers of public and private subnets per availability zone. This is useful
for common architectures where you need a single public subnet for load balancers but multiple private subnets
for different application tiers (web, app, data). You can specify the number and names of public and private
subnets independently using `public_subnets_per_az_count`/`public_subnets_per_az_names` and
`private_subnets_per_az_count`/`private_subnets_per_az_names` variables.

Rather than provide a wealth of configuration options allowing for numerous special cases, this module
provides some common options and further provides the ability to suppress the creation of resources, allowing
you to create and configure them as you like from outside this module. For example, rather than give you the
option to customize the Network ACL, the module gives you the option to create a completely open one (and control
access via Security Groups and other means) or not create one at all, allowing you to create and configure one yourself.

### Public subnets

This module defines a public subnet as one that has direct access to an internet gateway and can accept incoming connection requests. 
In the simplest configuration, the module creates a single route table with a default route targeted to the
VPC's internet gateway, and associates all the public subnets with that single route table. 

Likewise it creates a single Network ACL with associated rules allowing all ingress and all egress, 
and associates that ACL with all the public subnets. 

### Private subnets

A private subnet may be able to initiate traffic to the public internet through a NAT gateway,
a NAT instance, or an egress-only internet gateway, or it might only have direct access to other
private subnets. In the simple configuration, for IPv4 and/or IPv6 with NAT64 enabled via `public_dns64_enabled`
or `private_dns64_enabled`, the module creates 1 NAT Gateway or NAT Instance for each
private subnet (in the public subnet in the same availability zone), creates 1 route table for each private subnet, 
and adds to that route table a default route from the subnet to its NAT Gateway or Instance. For IPv6,
the module adds a route to the Egress-Only Internet Gateway configured via input.

As with the Public subnets, the module creates a single Network ACL with associated rules allowing all ingress and 
all egress, and associates that ACL with all the private subnets. 

### Customization for special use cases

Various features are controlled by `bool` inputs with names ending in `_enabled`. By changing the default
values, you can enable or disable creation of public subnets, private subnets, route tables, 
NAT gateways, NAT instances, or Network ACLs. So for example, you could use this module to create only
private subnets and the open Network ACL, and then add your own route table associations to the subnets
and route all non-local traffic to a Transit Gateway or VPN.

### CIDR allocation

For IPv4, you provide a CIDR and the module divides the address space into the largest CIDRs possible that are still
small enough to accommodate `max_subnet_count` subnets of each enabled type (public or private). When `max_subnet_count`
is left at the default `0`, it is set to the total number of availability zones in the region. Private subnets
are allocated out of the first half of the reserved range, and public subnets are allocated out of the second half.

For IPv6, you provide a `/56` CIDR and the module assigns `/64` subnets of that CIDR in consecutive order starting
at zero. (You have the option of specifying a list of CIDRs instead.) As with IPv4, enough CIDRs are allocated to
cover `max_subnet_count` private and public subnets (when both are enabled, which is the default), with the private
subnets being allocated out of the lower half of the reservation and the public subnets allocated out of the upper half.

## Deployment Modes and Configuration

This module supports various deployment modes through flexible configuration variables. Understanding these options
allows you to tailor the subnet architecture to your specific use case.

### Availability Zone Selection

**`availability_zones`** - Explicitly specify which AZs to use:
- Provide a list of AZ names (e.g., `["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]`)
- The list order **must be stable** - do not reorder or Terraform will recreate subnets
- If empty, the module uses all available AZs in the region (sorted alphabetically)
- Can be truncated by `max_subnet_count` if you specify more AZs than the limit

**`availability_zone_ids`** - Use AZ IDs instead of names:
- Provide a list of AZ IDs (e.g., `["use1-az1", "use1-az2"]`)
- Overrides `availability_zones` when set
- Useful for multi-account consistency (AZ names like "us-east-1a" map to different physical locations across accounts, but AZ IDs are consistent)
- The module automatically translates IDs to names for resource creation

### Subnet Count and CIDR Reservation

**`max_subnet_count`** - Controls CIDR reservation for future growth:
- Default: `0` (reserves CIDRs for all AZs in the region)
- Recommended: Set to `3` or the maximum number of AZs you anticipate using
- The module reserves CIDR space for this many subnets of **each type** (public and private)
- Example: If a region has 4 AZs but you set `max_subnet_count = 3`, only 3 subnets will be created, but you can later expand to the 4th without changing existing subnet CIDRs
- **Important**: This must be a constant value, not computed, due to Terraform limitations

**`subnets_per_az_count`** - Create multiple subnets of each type per AZ:
- Default: `1` (one public and one private subnet per AZ)
- Set to `2` or higher to create multiple subnets per AZ
- Creates the **same number** of public and private subnets
- Useful for segmenting workloads within the same AZ (e.g., separate subnets for web tier, app tier, data tier)
- Each subnet gets its own CIDR from the allocated range
- Works with `subnets_per_az_names` for organized outputs

**`subnets_per_az_names`** - Assign names to subnets for better organization:
- Default: `["common"]`
- Provide a list of names matching `subnets_per_az_count` (e.g., `["web", "app", "data"]`)
- Names are used as keys in the `named_private_subnets_map` and `named_public_subnets_map` outputs
- Makes it easy to reference specific subnet groups in other modules
- Example: `module.subnets.named_private_subnets_map["web"]` returns all web-tier private subnet IDs

**`public_subnets_per_az_count`** - Set a different number of public subnets per AZ:
- Default: `null` (uses `subnets_per_az_count` for backward compatibility)
- Set this when you need a different number of public vs private subnets
- Common pattern: Set to `1` for a single public subnet (for load balancers) while having multiple private subnets
- Must be greater than 0 if specified
- Works independently from `private_subnets_per_az_count`

**`public_subnets_per_az_names`** - Assign names specifically to public subnets:
- Default: `null` (uses `subnets_per_az_names` for backward compatibility)
- Provide a list of names matching `public_subnets_per_az_count`
- Names are used as keys in the `named_public_subnets_map` output
- Example: `["public-lb"]` for a single load balancer subnet per AZ

**`private_subnets_per_az_count`** - Set a different number of private subnets per AZ:
- Default: `null` (uses `subnets_per_az_count` for backward compatibility)
- Set this when you need a different number of private vs public subnets
- Common pattern: Set to `3` for multi-tier architecture (web, app, data) while having only 1 public subnet
- Must be greater than 0 if specified
- Works independently from `public_subnets_per_az_count`

**`private_subnets_per_az_names`** - Assign names specifically to private subnets:
- Default: `null` (uses `subnets_per_az_names` for backward compatibility)
- Provide a list of names matching `private_subnets_per_az_count`
- Names are used as keys in the `named_private_subnets_map` output
- Example: `["web", "app", "data"]` for a three-tier architecture

### Subnet Type Selection

**`public_subnets_enabled`** - Enable/disable public subnet creation:
- Default: `true`
- Set to `false` to create only private subnets
- When disabled, NAT Gateways/Instances are also disabled (since they require public subnets)
- Use case: Internal-only VPCs that route through Transit Gateway or VPN

**`private_subnets_enabled`** - Enable/disable private subnet creation:
- Default: `true`
- Set to `false` to create only public subnets
- When disabled, NAT Gateways/Instances are also disabled (since private subnets don't need them)
- Use case: DMZ or edge VPCs with only internet-facing resources

### NAT Configuration and Cost Optimization

**`max_nats`** - Limit the number of NAT devices for cost savings:
- Default: `999` (creates one NAT per AZ for high availability)
- Set to `1` for cost savings (single NAT, reduced availability)
- Set to `2` for balance between cost and availability (two NATs across AZs)
- **Cost impact**: Each NAT Gateway costs ~$32/month plus data transfer fees
- **Availability impact**: If the NAT fails (or its AZ fails), private subnets lose internet access
- The module distributes NAT devices across the first N availability zones
- Example: With 3 AZs and `max_nats = 1`, only the first AZ gets a NAT Gateway

**`nat_gateway_public_subnet_indices`** - Control which public subnet gets the NAT Gateway:
- Default: `[0]` (place NAT in the first public subnet of each AZ)
- When you have multiple public subnets per AZ, this determines which one hosts the NAT Gateway
- NAT Gateways are shared - one NAT per AZ serves all private subnets in that AZ
- **Important**: Each subnet index must be less than `public_subnets_per_az_count`
- Example: With `public_subnets_per_az_count = 2` and `nat_gateway_public_subnet_indices = [0]`, the NAT goes in the first public subnet
- Advanced: Set to `[0, 1]` to create redundant NATs within each AZ (rarely needed, increases cost)
- Example: If you have public subnets named `["lb", "bastion"]`, use `[0]` to place NAT in "lb" subnet or `[1]` to place it in "bastion" subnet

### Common Deployment Patterns

**Standard HA deployment** (default):
```hcl
# 1 public + 1 private subnet per AZ, with NAT Gateway per AZ
public_subnets_enabled  = true
private_subnets_enabled = true
max_subnet_count        = 3  # Reserve space for 3 AZs
max_nats                = 999 # One NAT per AZ
```

**Cost-optimized deployment**:
```hcl
# Single NAT Gateway shared across all private subnets
max_nats = 1
# Everything else default
```

**Private-only with Transit Gateway**:
```hcl
# Private subnets only, routing through TGW
public_subnets_enabled  = false
private_subnets_enabled = true
nat_gateway_enabled     = false
# Add custom routes to TGW externally
```

**Public-only (DMZ) deployment**:
```hcl
# Public subnets only for internet-facing resources
public_subnets_enabled  = true
private_subnets_enabled = false
```

**Multi-tier architecture per AZ** (legacy approach - same number of public and private):
```hcl
# 3 private AND 3 public subnets per AZ (web, app, data)
subnets_per_az_count = 3
subnets_per_az_names = ["web", "app", "data"]
# Access subnets via: named_private_subnets_map["web"]
```

**Multi-tier with separate public/private counts** (recommended):
```hcl
# 1 public subnet per AZ for load balancers
# 3 private subnets per AZ for web, app, and data tiers
public_subnets_per_az_count  = 1
public_subnets_per_az_names  = ["public-lb"]
private_subnets_per_az_count = 3
private_subnets_per_az_names = ["web", "app", "data"]
# NAT Gateway automatically goes in the first (and only) public subnet
nat_gateway_public_subnet_indices = [0]  # Default, can be omitted
# Access subnets via:
#   named_public_subnets_map["public-lb"]
#   named_private_subnets_map["web"]
#   named_private_subnets_map["app"]
#   named_private_subnets_map["data"]
```

**Multiple public subnets with controlled NAT placement**:
```hcl
# 2 public subnets per AZ: one for ALB, one for bastion hosts
# Place NAT Gateway in the ALB subnet (index 0)
public_subnets_per_az_count       = 2
public_subnets_per_az_names       = ["alb", "bastion"]
nat_gateway_public_subnet_indices = [0]  # NAT in "alb" subnet
# Result: 1 NAT per AZ in the "alb" subnet, shared by all private subnets
```

**Multiple private + multiple public with one NAT in specific subnet**:
```hcl
# Real-world example: Database, app tiers + load balancer and web frontends
# 3 private subnets per AZ (database, app1, app2)
# 2 public subnets per AZ (loadbalancer, web)
# 1 NAT Gateway per AZ in the "loadbalancer" subnet

availability_zones = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]

private_subnets_per_az_count = 3
private_subnets_per_az_names = ["database", "app1", "app2"]

public_subnets_per_az_count  = 2
public_subnets_per_az_names  = ["loadbalancer", "web"]

nat_gateway_public_subnet_indices = [0]  # NAT in "loadbalancer" subnet

# Result per AZ:
# - 3 private subnets: database, app1, app2
# - 2 public subnets: loadbalancer, web
# - 1 NAT Gateway in "loadbalancer" subnet
# - All 3 private subnets route to the same NAT
# Total: 3 NAT Gateways (one per AZ) = ~$96/month
```

**Multiple private + multiple public with NAT in EACH public subnet** (high availability):
```hcl
# Advanced: Redundant NAT Gateways within each AZ for maximum availability
# 3 private subnets per AZ (database, app1, app2)
# 2 public subnets per AZ (loadbalancer, web)
# 2 NAT Gateways per AZ (one in each public subnet)

availability_zones = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]

private_subnets_per_az_count = 3
private_subnets_per_az_names = ["database", "app1", "app2"]

public_subnets_per_az_count  = 2
public_subnets_per_az_names  = ["loadbalancer", "web"]

nat_gateway_public_subnet_indices = [0, 1]  # NAT in BOTH subnets

# Result per AZ:
# - 3 private subnets: database, app1, app2
# - 2 public subnets: loadbalancer, web
# - 2 NAT Gateways: one in "loadbalancer", one in "web"
# - Private subnets distributed across NATs:
#   - "database" → NAT in "loadbalancer"
#   - "app1" → NAT in "web"
#   - "app2" → NAT in "loadbalancer"
# Total: 6 NAT Gateways (2 per AZ × 3 AZs) = ~$192/month
# WARNING: This is expensive. Use only if you need intra-AZ NAT redundancy.
```

**Multi-account with consistent AZs**:
```hcl
# Use AZ IDs for consistency across accounts
availability_zone_ids = ["use1-az1", "use1-az2", "use1-az4"]
# These map to the same physical locations across all accounts
```

## Usage

```hcl
module "subnets" {
  source = "cloudposse/dynamic-subnets/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"
  namespace           = "eg"
  stage               = "prod"
  name                = "app"
  vpc_id              = "vpc-XXXXXXXX"
  igw_id              = ["igw-XXXXXXXX"]
  ipv4_cidr_block     = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
}
```

Create only private subnets, route to transit gateway:

```hcl
module "private_tgw_subnets" {
  source = "cloudposse/dynamic-subnets/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"
  namespace           = "eg"
  stage               = "prod"
  name                = "app"
  vpc_id              = "vpc-XXXXXXXX"
  igw_id              = ["igw-XXXXXXXX"]
  ipv4_cidr_block     = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]

  nat_gateway_enabled    = false
  public_subnets_enabled = false
}

resource "aws_route" "private" {
  count = length(module.private_tgw_subnets.private_route_table_ids)

  route_table_id         = module.private_tgw_subnets.private_route_table_ids[count.index]
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  transit_gateway_id     = "tgw-XXXXXXXXX"
}
```

See [examples](examples) for working examples. In particular, see [examples/nacls](examples/nacls) 
for an example of how to create custom Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) outside of
but in conjunction with this module.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.

## Subnet calculation logic

`terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets` creates a set of subnets based on various CIDR inputs and 
the maximum possible number of subnets, which is `max_subnet_count` when specified or
the number of Availability Zones in the region when `max_subnet_count` is left at 
its default value of zero.

You can explicitly provide CIDRs for subnets via `ipv4_cidrs` and `ipv6_cidrs` inputs if you want,
but the usual use case is to provide a single CIDR which this module will subdivide into a set
of CIDRs as follows:

1. Get number of available AZ in the region:
```
existing_az_count = length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names)
```
2. Determine how many sets of subnets are being created. (Usually it is `2`: `public` and `private`): `subnet_type_count`.
3. Multiply the results of (1) and (2) to determine how many CIDRs to reserve:
```
cidr_count = existing_az_count * subnet_type_count
```

4. Calculate the number of bits needed to enumerate all the CIDRs:
```
subnet_bits = ceil(log(cidr_count, 2))
```
5. Reserve CIDRs for private subnets using [`cidrsubnet`](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/cidrsubnet): 
```
private_subnet_cidrs = [ for netnumber in range(0, existing_az_count): cidrsubnet(cidr_block, subnet_bits, netnumber) ]
```
6. Reserve CIDRs for public subnets in the second half of the CIDR block:
```
public_subnet_cidrs = [ for netnumber in range(existing_az_count, existing_az_count * 2): cidrsubnet(cidr_block, subnet_bits, netnumber) ]
```


Note that this means that, for example, in a region with 4 availability zones, if you specify only 3 availability zones 
in `var.availability_zones`, this module will still reserve CIDRs for the 4th zone. This is so that if you later
want to expand into that zone, the existing subnet CIDR assignments will not be disturbed. If you do not want
to reserve these CIDRs, set `max_subnet_count` to the number of zones you are actually using.

## Running Terraform Tests

We use [Atmos](https://atmos.tools) to streamline how Terraform tests are run. It centralizes configuration and wraps common test workflows with easy-to-use commands.

All tests are located in the [`test/`](test) folder.

Under the hood, tests are powered by Terratest together with our internal [Test Helpers](https://github.com/cloudposse/test-helpers) library, providing robust infrastructure validation.

Setup dependencies:
- Install Atmos ([installation guide](https://atmos.tools/install/))
- Install Go [1.24+ or newer](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Install Terraform or OpenTofu

To run tests:

- Run all tests:  
  ```sh
  atmos test run
  ```
- Clean up test artifacts:  
  ```sh
  atmos test clean
  ```
- Explore additional test options:  
  ```sh
  atmos test --help
  ```
The configuration for test commands is centrally managed. To review what's being imported, see the [`atmos.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/.github/refs/heads/main/.github/atmos/terraform-module.yaml) file.

Learn more about our [automated testing in our documentation](https://docs.cloudposse.com/community/contribute/automated-testing/) or implementing [custom commands](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/custom-commands/) with atmos.
