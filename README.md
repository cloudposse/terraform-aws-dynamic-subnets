# terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets [![Codefresh Build Status](https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/pipeline/cloudposse/terraform-modules%2Fterraform-aws-dynamic-subnets?type=cf-1)](https://g.codefresh.io/public/accounts/cloudposse/pipelines/5d02dad8572be040f879f8ed) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision public and private [`subnets`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html) in an existing [`VPC`](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc)

__Note:__ this module is intended for use with an existing VPC and existing Internet Gateway.
To create a new VPC, use [terraform-aws-vpc](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc) module.

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets/releases).


```hcl
module "subnets" {
  source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets.git?ref=master"
  namespace           = "eg"
  stage               = "prod"
  name                = "app"
  region              = "us-east-1"
  vpc_id              = "vpc-XXXXXXXX"
  igw_id              = "igw-XXXXXXXX"
  cidr_block          = "10.0.0.0/16"
  availability_zones  = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
}
```

Learn about [using providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration-0-11/modules.html#providers-within-modules) with terraform modules.






## Subnet calculation logic

`terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets` creates a set of subnets based on `${var.cidr_block}` input and number of Availability Zones in the region.

For subnet set calculation, the module uses Terraform interpolation

[cidrsubnet](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html#cidrsubnet-iprange-newbits-netnum-).


```
${
  cidrsubnet(
  signum(length(var.cidr_block)) == 1 ?
  var.cidr_block : data.aws_vpc.default.cidr_block,
  ceil(log(length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names) * 2, 2)),
  count.index)
}
```


1. Use `${var.cidr_block}` input (if specified) or
   use a VPC CIDR block `data.aws_vpc.default.cidr_block` (e.g. `10.0.0.0/16`)
2. Get number of available AZ in the region (e.g. `length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names)`)
3. Calculate `newbits`. `newbits` number specifies how many subnets
   be the CIDR block (input or VPC) will be divided into. `newbits` is the number of `binary digits`.

    Example:

    `newbits = 1` - 2 subnets are available (`1 binary digit` allows to count up to `2`)

    `newbits = 2` - 4 subnets are available (`2 binary digits` allows to count up to `4`)

    `newbits = 3` - 8 subnets are available (`3 binary digits` allows to count up to `8`)

    etc.

    1. We know, that we have `6` AZs in a `us-east-1` region (see step 2).
    2. We need to create `1 public` subnet and `1 private` subnet in each AZ,
       thus we need to create `12 subnets` in total (`6` AZs * (`1 public` + `1 private`)).
    3. We need `4 binary digits` for that ( 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 ).
       In order to calculate the number of `binary digits` we should use `logarithm`
       function. We should use `base 2` logarithm because decimal numbers
       can be calculated as `powers` of binary number.
       See [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number#Decimal)
       for more details

       Example:

       For `12 subnets` we need `3.58` `binary digits` (log<sub>2</sub>12)

       For `16 subnets` we need `4` `binary digits` (log<sub>2</sub>16)

       For `7 subnets` we need `2.81` `binary digits` (log<sub>2</sub>7)

       etc.
    4. We can't use fractional values to calculate the number of `binary digits`.
       We can't round it down because smaller number of `binary digits` is
       insufficient to represent the required subnets.
       We round it up. See [ceil](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html#ceil-float-).

       Example:

       For `12 subnets` we need `4` `binary digits` (ceil(log<sub>2</sub>12))

       For `16 subnets` we need `4` `binary digits` (ceil(log<sub>2</sub>16))

       For `7 subnets` we need `3` `binary digits` (ceil(log<sub>2</sub>7))

       etc.

    5. Assign private subnets according to AZ number (we're using `count.index` for that).
    6. Assign public subnets according to AZ number but with a shift according to the number of AZs in the region (see step 2)
